# R66 — Protected purchase window for batch-row front-running

Status: **assigned** · Assigned: yes · Optional/further-review: no

## Objective

Give the swapper a narrowly bounded incident-response mechanism for a malicious schedule owner who
repeatedly changes their own row after the bot has prepared a batch, causing the shared purchase to
revert or to execute against a stale absolute minimum. The mechanism is dormant by default: an
authorized swapper may open a five-block protected purchase window whenever none is live, during which
only the user mutations that can invalidate an already prepared batch are refused.

This is an explicit proportionality decision. Normal batches keep their existing all-or-nothing
semantics and gas cost. Benign same-block edits may still revert a batch when no protected window was
opened; the protocol accepts that availability risk rather than permanently redesigning the manager,
handler funding hooks, calldata, and purchase ABI around a low-incentive denial-of-service scenario.

## Background

Found during review of [R64](./R64-batch-calldata-and-schedule-keying.md) (PR
[#119](https://github.com/BitChillRSK/dca-contracts/pull/119)). A batch is composed off-chain, then
`DcaManager` reads current storage when the purchase lands. In between, a schedule owner can pause,
delete, withdraw from, or edit a quoted schedule. The resulting row revert unwinds every other row in
the batch. Raising `purchaseAmount` is different: the purchase may proceed with an absolute
`minRbtcOut` that was quoted for a smaller input and therefore no longer expresses the intended price
tolerance.

The chosen response is an opt-in cross-transaction execution window:

1. An authorized swapper calls `activateProtectedPurchaseWindow` and waits for inclusion.
2. Once the lock is onchain, the bot refreshes the relevant state and rebuilds or simulates the batch.
3. The bot broadcasts the purchase only after the activation receipt, and before the five-block window
   ends.

The repository's indexer treats 12 Rootstock confirmations as finalized, but the protected flow acts
on inclusion rather than waiting for that threshold. Five blocks therefore provide four subsequent
inclusion opportunities, not finality. [Rootstock's block-time proposal](https://ips.rootstock.io/IPs/RSKIP517.html)
describes a 14-second target and roughly 24-second observed main-block interval, so that is typically
around one to two minutes rather than a guaranteed wall-clock duration. If operations later require waiting 12
confirmations after activation, or cannot reliably refresh and submit inside those four following
blocks, this fixed window is too short and must be revisited before adopting that workflow. The same
is true if one tick must be split beyond those four opportunities: R64 measured roughly 525 rows per
transaction, so a tick materially above 2,000 rows could leave a tail outside the protected window.

Activation is not a purchase reservation and has no daily budget. If the protected purchase fails for
an unrelated reason, the swapper waits for the window to expire and may activate again. An active
window still cannot be extended: that is what keeps any single lock to five blocks. Nothing onchain
requires a purchase to land before `N + 5`; the bot must enforce that deadline. There is no onchain
UTC-day gate — BitChill's incentive is to complete fee-earning purchases, not to hold user exits, and
re-activating costs the swapper gas, so a once-per-day quota only punished a failed protected attempt
without buying real abuse resistance.

### Why the absolute minimum stays

A rate applied to measured spend is useful when a lending redemption returns less stablecoin than
planned: it preserves the quoted *price* floor while scaling the required rBTC down with the actual
input. The current absolute minimum is stricter in amount terms and may revert instead. That is a
liveness improvement, not additional protection against the owner front-run once the protected
window prevents `purchaseAmount` and the funding book from changing after the refreshed snapshot.

Changing to a rate would also alter bot semantics and thread new arithmetic through `DcaManager`,
`PurchaseRbtc`, `PurchaseUniswap`, and their interfaces. R66 therefore keeps `minRbtcOut` absolute.
A future item may reconsider rate semantics on their independent merits, but they are not part of
this denial-of-service response.

## Open product decisions

**none** — decided 2026-09-06; daily budget dropped 2026-09-06 (review):

- Five-block global window, fixed in code.
- No daily activation budget. An authorized swapper may activate whenever no window is live; an active
  window still cannot be extended or renewed early.
- The lock is dormant until a swapper activates it. Purchases never require activation.
- Only mutations that can invalidate an already prepared row are blocked. Reads, deposits, schedule
  creation, interest top-ups, accumulated-rBTC withdrawals, purchases, and governance setters remain
  available.
- Keep the existing absolute `minRbtcOut`, batch calldata, handler ABI, funding behavior, and
  all-or-nothing batch semantics.

## Scope

- [x] Add `activateProtectedPurchaseWindow`, callable only by an address currently authorized as a
      swapper by the constructor-pinned `OperationsAdmin`.
- [x] Store the block at which user mutations resume (`uint64`; zero = never activated).
- [x] Lock exactly five block heights including the activation block: activation in block `N` allows
      the guarded functions again in block `N + 5`.
- [x] Reject activation only while a window is still live; after expiry the swapper may activate again
      with no daily quota.
- [x] During the window reject `updatePurchaseAmount`, `updatePurchasePeriod`, `setSchedulePaused`,
      `deleteDcaSchedule`, `withdrawToken`, `withdrawTokenAndInterest`, and
      `withdrawAllAccumulatedInterest`.
- [x] Keep `depositToken`, `createDcaSchedule`, `topUpFromInterest`, accumulated-rBTC withdrawals,
      getters, owner setters, and both purchase entry points available.
- [x] Add public getters for the unlock block and current activation eligibility, an activation event,
      and a distinct custom error when a window is still live. Index only the activating swapper
      address.
- [x] Name the row in `DcaManager__CannotBuyIfPurchasePeriodHasNotElapsed`, the one purchase-path
      revert that did not, so an unprotected tick can drop the offending schedule and retry rather
      than rebuild. This is what makes retry-on-failure — not activation before every tick — the
      correct default.
- [x] Update the durable invariant and consumer follow-ups for the new public surface.

## Out of scope

- [ ] Skipping stale or underfunded rows.
- [ ] Packed expected purchase amounts or a batch sorting requirement.
- [ ] Changing `minRbtcOut` from an absolute amount to a rate.
- [ ] Moving schedule effects after the handler call or adding handler-to-manager funding results.
- [ ] Cross-handler isolation in `batchBuyRbtcAcrossHandlers`.
- [ ] Exact equality between user shares debited and protocol shares redeemed; deferred to
      [R67](./R67-exact-batch-share-accounting.md).
- [ ] Changes to handlers, purchase routes, or deploy scripts.

- `src/interfaces/IDcaManager.sol`
- `test/unit/ProtectedPurchaseWindowTest.t.sol`

## Required tests

- `forge test --match-path test/unit/ProtectedPurchaseWindowTest.t.sol`
- A swapper can activate a window; an unauthorized account cannot.
- Activation at block `N` blocks every listed mutation in blocks `N` through `N + 4`, and each is
  available again at `N + 5`.
- A second activation while the window is live reverts. After expiry the swapper may activate again
  immediately (no UTC-day quota).
- Deposits, creation, top-ups, accumulated-rBTC withdrawals, owner setters, and purchases do not take
  the lock modifier. Structural assertions should make additions or removals from the guarded set
  visible in review.
- A batch prepared after activation succeeds while an attempted owner mutation is locked.
- Existing absolute-minimum behavior and batch ABI remain unchanged.
- Fork tests add no R66-specific assertions, but `make fork-sovryn` and `make fork-tropykus` remain the
  before-push gate.

### Why the default is retry, not activate-every-tick

Eligibility for a purchase is day-granular, so a bot *could* open a window before every tick and cover
benign same-block edits too. That is deliberately not the default. Activating turns each daily tick
into two sequential transactions with a mandatory wait-for-receipt and refresh between them —
permanent machinery in the critical path, plus a failure mode where the activation lands and the
purchase does not — and it freezes every user's exits for five blocks per activation. The failure it
would prevent is self-healing: eligibility is day-granular, so a retry hours later costs no user a
purchase. A rare, cheap, recoverable revert is the better trade against a permanent operational tax,
so the window stays dormant and the bot retries. Every purchase-path revert now names its schedule,
so that retry drops one row rather than rebuilding. When the bot *does* need the window (repeated
hostile edits), it may reopen after expiry without waiting for a UTC-day rollover.

## Success criteria

- [x] Once activation is included and the bot refreshes its snapshot, no guarded owner mutation can
      invalidate the refreshed batch during the five-block window.
- [x] No authorized swapper can extend an active window; after expiry another activation is allowed.
- [x] The mechanism adds no storage write and no lock branch to an ordinary purchase transaction.
- [x] No handler or purchase-route implementation changes.
- [x] The existing `Batch` and `IPurchaseRbtc` ABIs and absolute-minimum semantics are unchanged.
- [x] `make check`, `make fork-sovryn`, and `make fork-tropykus` pass.

## Validation record

- `SWAP_TYPE=mocSwaps LENDING_PROTOCOL=sovryn STABLECOIN_TYPE=DOC forge test --match-path
  test/unit/ProtectedPurchaseWindowTest.t.sol`: 7 passed.
- `make check`: all unit/fuzz lanes passed (839 tests in the final reported lane set), then all 11
  Sovryn invariants passed at 64 runs × 512 calls with zero reverts.
- `make fork-sovryn`: 380 passed, 26 skipped.
- `make fork-tropykus`: 373 passed, 30 skipped.
  Both drop one against the previous record: the two daily-budget tests are gone and one replaces them.
- Default-profile `DcaManager` runtime is 14,023 B versus 13,487 B at the exact PR base: +536 B.
  Dropping the daily budget took 186 B off the 14,209 B the capped version measured.
  The four gas fixtures below are byte-identical before and after that change; only the failure path
  carries more data.
- On the MoC/Sovryn test, `testSinglePurchase` is 248,667 gas versus 248,843 at base (−176), and the
  five-row `testBatchPurchasesOneUser` is 1,789,828 versus 1,789,481 (+347, 0.019%). There is no
  window read in either purchase entry; this tiny movement is compiler/dispatcher layout, not a
  per-row lock cost. With the day marker gone, activation writes one `uint64` in one slot, with no
  manual bit math and no second field to merge; the activation fixture is 47,580 gas, down from
  48,328 with the daily budget. Guarded user calls do pay
  one permanent cold read: in the `mocSwaps`/`sovryn`/`DOC` lane the sentinel `withdrawToken` fixture
  (`test_sentinelWithdrawsTheWholeScheduleBalance`) is 108,608 gas versus 106,888 at base (+1,720,
  1.61%), and `withdrawTokenAndInterest` (`test_withdrawTokenAndInterestWithTheSentinelExitsThePosition`)
  is 176,615 versus 174,575 (+2,040, 1.17%) — both deltas track the same single added cold `SLOAD`.
  A *refused* guarded call is cheaper than it would otherwise be: `whenUserMutationsAllowed` precedes
  `nonReentrant` on the seven guarded mutations, so a refusal reverts before the guard's `SSTORE` and
  costs the caller ~5,100 gas less. That ordering is safe because the check is a private view over one
  slot; `AGENTS.md` invariant 6 is presence, not position.

## Reviewer checklist

- [x] Matches **Scope**; nothing from **Out of scope**.
- [x] The guarded function list is exact: every mutation that can invalidate a prepared row is
      covered, and unrelated exits are not.
- [x] An active window cannot be extended; after expiry the swapper may activate again (no daily
      quota).
- [x] Protocol invariants in `AGENTS.md` still hold.
- [x] Files beyond this list are limited to direct dependencies and are named in the PR.
- [x] No unrelated refactors; history is reviewable.

## ABI / deploy / cutover impact

- ABI: adds `activateProtectedPurchaseWindow()`, protected-window unlock and eligibility getters, one
  activation event, and two custom errors (`ProtectedPurchaseWindowStillActive`,
  `UserMutationsLocked`). One existing error signature changes:
  `DcaManager__CannotBuyIfPurchasePeriodHasNotElapsed(uint256 timeRemaining)` becomes
  `(address token, uint64 scheduleId, uint256 timeRemaining)`, matching the four other purchase-path
  reverts that already name the row. Every other selector, struct, event, and parameter meaning is
  unchanged.
- Scripts: none.
- Cutover: the swapper bot gains an incident flow: activate, wait for inclusion, refresh/simulate, then
  purchase within the window. It preflights with `canActivateProtectedPurchaseWindow()`, which now
  reports one thing — whether a window is live — rather than a calendar allowance. The frontend
  should present the temporary retry block when a guarded user mutation is refused, without promising
  it cannot recur the same day. Monitoring must alert on activation *frequency*: with the onchain
  quota gone, a sustained run of activations five blocks apart is the signature of a misbehaving
  swapper key, and off-chain alerting plus multisig removal from the allowlist is the control that
  replaces the quota. Update the existing R64/R66 follow-up issues rather than opening duplicates.
  Final corrections:
  [swapper-bot#7](https://github.com/BitChillRSK/swapper-bot/issues/7#issuecomment-5559758856),
  [bitchill-monitoring#10](https://github.com/BitChillRSK/bitchill-monitoring/issues/10#issuecomment-5559760788),
  and [front-end#24](https://github.com/BitChillRSK/front-end/issues/24#issuecomment-5559760898).
  The swapper bot carries the substantive change: with every stale-row revert naming its schedule, an
  unprotected tick recovers by dropping that row and resubmitting, which is the retry the dormant
  default relies on.
